# Vacuum-Cleaner-Software-Design
Designed a Vacuum Cleaner software with the following specifications
1)	Three speeds: low – Medium – High, two switches for increasing and decreasing the speed.
2)	Seven segment display for speed monitoring.
3)	Induction Motor soft switching feature between speeds: firing angle shifts 10 degrees for every 40 ms.
4)	Induction Motor soft start up: on starting the machine, the firing angle softly shifts from 170 degrees to 90 degrees (low to medium speed).
5)	Induction Motor harmonics reduction: firing angle shifts by ± 5 degrees for every 20 ms round its constant speed.
6)	Overload safety: using a pressure sensor (simulated by a button), when the storage tank is nearly full the sensor is active, the pressure led will turn on, and the machine will automatically reduce its speed every 30 seconds till reaching its lowest speed.
